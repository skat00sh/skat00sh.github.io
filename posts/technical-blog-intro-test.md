# My Technical Blog Design

I've been thinking about my technical blog design for a while now. I want to create a blog that is easy to read and easy to write. I want to be able to write about my technical work and share it with others.

## Introduction

Let's test if _italic_ and **bold** work.

### Lists
Would be good to test if lists work too.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Links
Awesome with external links too: [Google](https://www.google.com)

### Code Blocks
Would be good to test if code blocks work too.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Images
Would be good to test if images work too.
