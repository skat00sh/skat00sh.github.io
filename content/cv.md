## Professional Experience

### Verses Technologies 
**Sr. ML Research Engineer - Freelancer, Remote** | Mar 2024 - Present
- Working as Technical Lead for smart-warehouse use case under the Distributed AI on Edge (dAIEdge) initiative.

- Optimizing perception-to-action models using a hybrid Deep Learning and Active Inference based approach for both real-world and simulation testing.

- Collaborating with researchers to develop solutions for low-latency edge inference.

- Applied research on smart-routing agents using ROS2 Active Inference (Variational Bayesian Inference) in simulation (ISAAC Omniverse) and on real-world AMRs and drones.

_Publication:_ “Towards smart and adaptive agents for active sensing on edge devices”, D. Vyas, M. De Prado, T. Verbelen, HiPeac 2025.​

### Edge Case Research GmbH 
**Machine Learning Engineer - Munich, Germany** | May 2020 – Jan 2022
- My role evolved from conducting deep learning experiments to MLOps, and further to developing project roadmaps for
customers, focusing on safety-centered autonomous agents
- Defined KPIs, iterative model improvements and feature set analysis for Autonomous Trains
- Collaborated in Agile environments to deliver iterative ML solutions aligned with customer requirements
- Deployed end-to-end pipeline with Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) feature for ADAS on AWS
- Extended the Object Detection module from 2D to 3D Bouding Boxes

### Machine Learning Engineer 
**TerraLoupe GmbH - Munich, Germany** | Oct 2019 – Apr 2020
- My responsibility involved improving toolchains for deep learning experiments to enhance their reproducibility and
trackability.
- Sourced, Cleaned and Automated MLOps pipeline for large-scale aerial image segmentation dataset
- Integrated ML experimentation tracking using Sacred and Omniboard

### ADAS Engineer 
**KPIT Technologies GmbH - Munich, Germany** | Jan 2019 – Aug 2019
- My task was to create a Vehicle State Monitor that handles high-frequency data from multiple sensors on the car
• Developed a GUI dashboard that can process processes high-frequency data to monitor and visualise the real-time health
of vehicles
- Designed the testing module for the Test Driven Development(TDD) of the Vehicle State Monitor (VSM)
- Contributed to coding standards, code reviews, and source control management

### Software Engineer 
**CNRS (XLIM Lab) - Poitiers, France** | Jan 2017 – Aug 2018
- My responsibility was to integrate and optimize an algorithm for a simulator that visualizes radio wave propagation.
- Optimized run-times by approx. 30% and streamlining system reliability
_Publication_: CupCarbon: A new platform for the design, simulation and 2D/3D visualization of radio propagation and
interferences in IoT networks
